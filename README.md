# Project Title: Fully Dispersed Haar-like Filters for Facial Expressions Recognition

## Description
This repository contains the MATLAB code and datasets for implementing the **Fully Dispersed Haar-like Filter** for feature extraction of face images. The goal of this project is to provide a Fully Dispersed Haar-like Filter for feature extraction, as proposed by **Z. Sedaghtjoo, H. Hosseinzadeh, and A. Shirzadi** in [[1]]. So a berief introduction about the subject is proposed here:

Haar-like filters are renowned for their simplicity, speed, and accuracy in various computer vision tasks.
Haar-like features are local texture descriptors that quantify differences in the average intensity values between adjacent rectangular regions. The following figure illustrates several simple Haar-like filters that
are commonly employed in feature extraction applications.

As illustrated in above figure, Haar-like filters are commonly represented as combinations of two or more rectangular regions composed of black and white pixels. 
This figure showcases various examples of Haar-like filters, with the default weights clearly indicated on their respective rectangles. These filters can be applied for facial feature extraction as is shown in the next figure:

The feature value g for a Haar-like filter is defined as follows:

*g(x) = v1 m1(x) + v2 m2(x),* 

where x is an image, and m1 and m2 denote the mean intensities of the pixels within the black and white regions of the filter, respectively. The weights v1 and v2 correspond to these regions and are typically represented as two integers whose sum equals zero.
Numerous algorithms are available for determining the optimal values of weights. 
This code focuses specifically on identifying optimal Haar-like filters characterized by equal black and white regions. Then, the
weights are assigned as v1 = âˆ’1 and v2 = 1.

Paper [[1]] introduces a novel filter as an extreme case of the Haar-like filters, named **fully dispersed Haar-like filters**. A distinctive feature of these new filters is their adaptability, allowing pixels to reposition themselves dynamically to optimize the detection of local
features. These filters mark a significant advancement within the Haar-like framework, merging ease of use with improved accuracy in feature detection. To mitigate the risk of overfitting, we develop an optimization algorithm that facilitates the creation of locally
optimized dispersed Haar-like filters, specifically targeting regions of the face to enhance detection precision. Our approach is not limited to face detection; it also extends to facial expression recognition across seven distinct classes. The experimental results presented
in [[1]] demonstrate the superior performance of the newly optimized Haar-like filters, affirming their effectiveness in practical applications.

Then a novel code is proposed here to identify optimal fully dispersed Haar-like filters for enhanced facial feature extraction and recognition. Unlike traditional Haar-like filters, these novel filters allow pixels to move freely within images, enabling more effective capture of intricate local features. Through extensive experiments on face detection, this code shows that our optimized filters can distinguish between face images and clutter with minimal error, outperforming the algorithm presented in [[1]]. The following image displays the optimal Haar-like filters for face feature extraction, illustrating the variation in *filter size* from small to large.

The face and clutter images are distingushed linearly by the use of the fully dispersed Haar-like filters as is shown in the second row of the above figure [[1]]. Each column of this figure can be one of the outputs generated by this code. These filters achieve high accuracy, exceeding 90%, as demonstrated in the results of the code.

These filters also can be extracted for the facial experession recognaition with 7 distinct emotional classes: anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. The filter respect to this problem are shown in the next figure.

The figure is one of outputs of the code for facial expression recognition task. As one can see from the code, these features lead 86% and 94% accuracy when the linear and quadratic SVM are applied for classification, respectively.
Further details regarding the newly proposed filters and their results can be found in [[1]].

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sedaghatjoo/fully-dispersed-Haar-like-filter.git

   ```

2. Ensure you have MATLAB installed to run the code. The required version is **MATLAB R2020b** or newer.

## Usage
1. Open the MATLAB script **Fully_Dispered_HaarLike.m**.
2. Load the dataset files by running:
   ```matlab
   load('Clutter2.mat');
   load('Pics.mat');
   ```
   Pics matrix is data matrix of face images of size 64*64. The size of matrix is 1477*4096 which each row is deoted to an image.
   One can replace his data instead of it. s_pic is the size if images which is consdered as 64 here. The state is also valid for clutter matrix Clutter2. 

4. Run the script to start feature Extraction process.
   
   Before running the code, you can change the following paramers
   div=0.7 (The ratio of training to testing samples ),
   num1=256 (the number of black pixels of the filter)
   num2=256 (the number of white pixels of the filter) ...
   Wh=[-1,1] (the weights of black and whith parts of the filter)
   itter=200 (the number of itterations for training)
   
6. View the results in the MATLAB workspace.
   The results include the graph of error values for each iteration of the proposed algorith to optimize **fully dispersed Haar-like filters**.
   It is similar to the following figure include false positive and false nagative errors.
